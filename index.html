  <b>Bio</b>

  <p>I am Ben Kwapnioski. I am from Omaha, Nebraska. I like to travel around as much as I can. I recently graduated with my masters in business intelligence and analytics. I also started a sorftware engineering immersive course by offering to be a teachers assistant. I am really good at finding scholarships and things to keep learning. I love finding free ways to keep learning and connecting others to resources. I love taking what I learn and teaching it to others. I also have been volunteering a lot to get comfortable being uncomfortable by going to events. I am interested in technical support, data analytics, data science, data visualization and I love helping others. Check me out on LinkedIn. </p>
